  <p>It was wednesday when I first saw it.</p>
  <!--your mother-->
  <p>I had been walking home when it caught my eye. A shadow passing by the window in the attic. I told myself I was just imagining it. <del>But I knew what I saw.</del></p>
  <p>I didn't react. I didn't even flinch. But I knew it saw me too.</p>
  <p>I noticed a note on the front doorstep. it read:</p>

  <code><em>Why won't you leave me alone?</em></code>
 <!--don't look up-->
 <p>I crumpled up the paper and tossed it in the bushes beside me. I wasn't interested in it's games.</p>
  <p>I had things that I needed to do.</p>
